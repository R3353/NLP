Annotations Project and Survey on Multimodal Natural Language Processing projects.

**For portfolio/professional demonstration only.**

# Homeworks
- **HW 2**: Implemented a character-level RNN language model from scratch using PyTorch, with custom batching, tokenization, and training logic.
- **HW 3**: Fine-tuned pre-trained BERT models on a sentiment classification task using HuggingFace Transformers.
- **HW 4**: Designed zero-shot and few-shot prompts for sentiment classification using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 API, comparing model outputs under different tuning setups.
- **HW 6**: Analyzed and visualized word embeddings from trained models to explore how semantic relationships are encoded.

# Projects
## Annotations Project
- Task: Decide on a new document classification NLP task, annotate data to support it (including creating annotation guidelines), measure your inter-annotator agreement rate, and build a classifier to predict those labels using the methods we discuss in class.
- Project objective: Classify whether a dad joke is *funny, witty*, or *lame*.

## Survey
- Survey on Multimodal Natural Language processing.
- Reviewed at 25+ papers published in venues and publications related to the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). Those include ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AACL conferences, along with Transcations of the ACL and Computational Linguistics publications.
